### The Ultimate Math For Deep Learning Guide Using TensorFlow

###### By the end of this path you'll be able to implement most deep learning algorithms from scratch which will lead you to our ultimate goal of...classifying stuff as "hot-dog" or "not hot-dog"

#### In this repository I will attempt to teach myself all the required math I'd need to start doing research in DL

#### This will also include a deep dive into some very common Deep Neural Network Architectures such as **Feedforward**, **CNNs**, **RNNs**, etc.

#### Before we get into the fun stuff we'll first try to build a solid foundation in the necessary Maths, which will sadly contain less code than the later sections where we'll implement the deep learning algorithms from scratch

##### But eventually we'll be able to do exactly what we sought out to do...
